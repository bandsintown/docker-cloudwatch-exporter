  # This controls the retry behavior when an error is returned from Consul.
  # Consul Template is highly fault tolerant, meaning it does not exit in the
  # face of failure. Instead, it uses exponential back-off and retry functions
  # to wait for the cluster to become available, as is customary in distributed
  # systems.

  retry {
    # This enabled retries. Retries are enabled by default, so this is
    # redundant.
    enabled = true

    # This specifies the number of attempts to make before giving up. Each
    # attempt adds the exponential backoff sleep time. Setting this to
    # zero will implement an unlimited number of retries.
    attempts = 0

    # This is the base amount of time to sleep between retry attempts. Each
    # retry sleeps for an exponent of 2 longer than this base. For 5 retries,
    # the sleep times would be: 250ms, 500ms, 1s, 2s, then 4s.
    backoff = "1s"

    # This is the maximum amount of time to sleep between retry attempts.
    # When max_backoff is set to zero, there is no upper limit to the
    # exponential sleep between retry attempts.
    # If max_backoff is set to 10s and backoff is set to 1s, sleep times
    # would be: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 10s, 10s, ...

  command = "java -jar /cloudwatch_exporter.jar 9106 /config/config.yml"

  # This is a random splay to wait before killing the command. The default
  # value is 0 (no wait), but large clusters should consider setting a splay
  # value to prevent all child processes from reloading at the same time when
  # data changes occur. When this value is set to non-zero, Consul Template
  # will wait a random period of time up to the splay value before reloading
  # or killing the child process. This can be used to prevent the thundering
  # herd problem on applications that do not gracefully reload.

  # This defines the signal that will be sent to the child process when a
  # change occurs in a watched template. The signal will only be sent after the
  # process is started, and the process will only be started after all
  # dependent templates have been rendered at least once. The default value is
  # nil, which tells Consul Template to stop the child process and spawn a new
  # one instead of sending it a signal. This is useful for legacy applications
  # or applications that cannot properly reload their configuration without a
  # full reload.
  reload_signal = "SIGHUP"

  # This defines the signal sent to the child process when Consul Template is
  # gracefully shutting down. The application should begin a graceful cleanup.
  # If the application does not terminate before the `kill_timeout`, it will
  # be terminated (effectively "kill -9"). The default value is "SIGTERM".
  kill_signal = "SIGTERM"

  # This defines the amount of time to wait for the child process to gracefully
  # terminate when Consul Template exits. After this specified time, the child
  # process will be force-killed (effectively "kill -9"). The default value is
  # "30s".
  kill_timeout = "5s"

# This is the quiescence timers; it defines the minimum and maximum amount of
# time to wait for the cluster to reach a consistent state before rendering a
# template. This is useful to enable in systems that have a lot of flapping,
# because it will reduce the the number of times a template is rendered.
